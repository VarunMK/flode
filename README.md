# Flode

### Motivation
Imagine students living in rural areas with poor internet connectivity or students, who do not have access to laptops but still want to learn programming. There are no easy and accessible ways for students with a lack of laptop or personal computing devices to learn programming.
Introductory coding tutorials directly start teaching basic programming statements. But in reality, the fundamental way to crack any programming question is to develop problem-solving skills rather than to learn syntax. 


### What is Flode?
Flode is a mobile application that teaches programming through flowcharts. It incorporates beautiful animations and drag and drop physics by by allowing the user  to structure logical statements and solve programming / logical challenges. The application is completely offline which makes it easier for rural students to access all the features without an active internet connection. 

The goal is to make programming more interactive, enjoyable and accessible.
